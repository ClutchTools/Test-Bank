#Black & White Cookies

## Prompt

Build an HTML page (or web app) that:

Shows a user an image of either a red or blue ball upon visiting the page. This should be random, with a 50/50 chance of a user being shown either color ball.
Determine whether the user saw a black or a white ball and the next time a user visits the page show them the same color ball they saw previously.

Please work with cookies (and not local storage) to record how many times a user has seen each color of ball. You should be able to provide a report on users and number of times they saw each color ball.

The test should work in any browser (including Chrome). Style as necessary (it is very much appreciated if you do).

Code should be written in Javascript and feel free to use a framework for building the page/application. Any cookie functionality should not be abstracted by jQuery or any other module provided by NPM or the like.
