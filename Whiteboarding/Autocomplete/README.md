# Autocomplete
## Prompt

A common feature in applications is autocompletion of text. Let's create the function that would support this feature.

When given an array of options can you create a function that when given a string of letters would return all possible options?

Examples:

```
1.) 
Input: 'as', ['pear', 'apple', 'astor', 'ten', 'horse', 'asteroid']
Output: ['astor', 'asteroid']

```

Bonus:

Consider how you could optomize your soltuion to handle for hundreds of thousands of words and something that would, as you typed, call this function.
