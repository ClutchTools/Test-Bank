## Solution

This problem revolves more aorund your problem solving abilities and how you think about problems rather than javascript solutions. In that sense this problem is more mathmatical than coding.

Hopefully the person being whiteboarded asks the question of what number of people have the flip a switch for it to be still be on at the end and come to realiization that this number has to be odd. 

After realizing this they should then realize that this translates to the number of factors a number has and that the lightbulbs will have an odd number of factors.

From there this should lead them to realize that only numbers with odd numbers of factors will be perfect squares so if you can count the number of perfect squares in a range you can easily solve this problem in constant time!
