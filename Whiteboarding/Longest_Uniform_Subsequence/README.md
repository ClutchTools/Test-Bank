# Longest Uniform Subsequence
## Prompt

Given a string, find the longest uniform subsequence in the string,
return an array where the first number is the start index of the subsequence, 
and the second number is the length of the subsequence.

A uniform subsequence is defined as any subsequence where all the
characters are the same.

```
Examples:

"" -> [-1, 0]
"aaabbbbccd" -> [3, 4]
"hello world" -> [2, 2]

```
