# Add Reversed Linked List
## Prompt

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as an array

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Solve for linear time complexity -> O(N)

Example to give
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) , (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: [7, 0, 8]
