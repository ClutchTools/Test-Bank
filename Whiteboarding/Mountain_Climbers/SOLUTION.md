## Solution

### Common Questions
* Will there be duplicate values or all integers will be unique?
```
A.) Duplicate maximum values is the more difficult version of this problem which the included solution
will not handle. Same for duplicate minimums. There will be duplicate values though inbetween that are
not the maximum or minimum value.
```
* Will I be given anything besides a 2D array of integers?
```
A.) No they will only be given a 2D array of integers
```
* Will the 2D array always be a square?
```
A.) The 2D array will always be either a square or a rectangle
```

### Edge Cases
* No path to return
```
Example:
[
[4, 3, 5, 1]
[2, 2, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6, 2]
[5, 2, 8, 7]
]

If no path, return undefined
```
* Negative Numbers
```
Example:
[
[-2, -5, -1]
[2, 0, 1]
[5, 6, -1]
]

When finding min and max position the person's inital variable have to be min= infinity, max = -infinity,
or both equal to null/undefined
```
* Flat Plane/Local Maximum
```
Example:
[
[0,3,4,5,6,6,3]
[1,3,4,3,6,6,3]
[2,3,4,3,3,3,3]
[4,4,4,5,6,7,9]
]

A solution without keeping track of where the person have moved from would hit an infinite loop
in this solution. Any data structure that keeps track of places been and they implement a check
against it with each step would handle this.
